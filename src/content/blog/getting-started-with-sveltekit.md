# Getting Started with SvelteKit

SvelteKit is a modern web framework that makes building fast, efficient web applications a breeze. Unlike other frameworks that do most of their work in the browser, Svelte compiles your code to vanilla JavaScript at build time, resulting in smaller bundle sizes and better performance.

## What Makes SvelteKit Special?

SvelteKit combines the best of Svelte with powerful features for building full-stack applications:

- **Zero Runtime Overhead**: Svelte compiles to vanilla JavaScript
- **File-based Routing**: Intuitive routing based on your file structure
- **Server-Side Rendering**: Built-in SSR and static site generation
- **TypeScript Support**: First-class TypeScript integration
- **Hot Module Replacement**: Lightning-fast development experience

## Setting Up Your First Project

Getting started with SvelteKit is straightforward:

```bash
npm create svelte@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

This creates a new SvelteKit project with all the necessary configurations and dependencies.

## Key Features

### Component-Based Architecture

Svelte components are self-contained units that encapsulate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:

```svelte
<script>
	let count = 0;

	function increment() {
		count += 1;
	}
</script>

<button on:click={increment}>
	Count: {count}
</button>

<style>
	button {
		background: #ff3e00;
		color: white;
		border: none;
		padding: 8px 16px;
		border-radius: 4px;
	}
</style>
```

### Reactive Statements

Svelte's reactivity system automatically updates the DOM when state changes:

```svelte
<script>
	let name = 'world';

	// Reactive statement
	$: greeting = `Hello ${name}!`;
</script>

<input bind:value={name} /><p>{greeting}</p>
```

## Conclusion

SvelteKit offers a refreshing approach to web development with its compile-time optimizations and intuitive API. Whether you're building a simple static site or a complex web application, SvelteKit provides the tools you need to create fast, maintainable code.
